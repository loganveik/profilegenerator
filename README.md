the assignment has 2 parts, the username input which dispalys the users github info to the page, and the color input which the user can type whatever color and the background of the displayed image is whatever color the user chose. I couldnt figure out how to do the color part. But i did the basic assignment which was to display the users github info to the page and transform into a pdf.
